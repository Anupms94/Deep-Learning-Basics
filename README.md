# Deep-Learning-Basics
Consider leaving a ‚≠ê if you like this series of tutorials.

This repo gets you started with Deep Learning the hard way, that is without using the basic maths libraris to code the models. Then it introduces you to TensorFlow. This will be all about about coding Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. I believe in hands-on coding so we will have many exercises and demos which you can try yourself too. There are different Jupyter Notebooks that you can go through.
